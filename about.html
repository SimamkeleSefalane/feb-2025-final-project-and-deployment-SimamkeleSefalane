                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Simamkele Sefalane, a passionate tech enthusiast and web developer. With a background in
                    RPA Development and Technical Support, I am exploring the world of software engineering and web
                    development. My goal
                    is to blend my automation skills with technology to create innovative solutions, while continuously
                    learning and growing in this dynamic field.

                    On this website, you'll find a collection of my projects, skills, experience, and certifications.
                    Iâ€™m
                    excited about the endless possibilities in the tech world, particularly in web development, data
                    analytics, and the impact of technology on industries like education and healthcare. Thank you for
                    visiting, and feel free to explore my work! </p>

                <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>

                    <h2>HOW I GOT INTO TECH</h2>
                    <p>From an early age, I was always curious about how things workedâ€”especially when it came to
                        technology.
                        Whether it was fixing gadgets around the house or figuring out how software operated, I found
                        myself
                        drawn to the tech world long before I knew it would become my career path.</p>

                    <p>But my journey into IT hasnâ€™t been a straight lineâ€”itâ€™s been a blend of exploration, learning,
                        and
                        embracing change.</p>

                    <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>After completing my matric at Luhlaza High School, I pursued a Higher Certificate in Dental
                        Assisting at
                        the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. While I appreciated the healthcare field, I
                        realized my
                        true passion lay elsewhere. I wanted to be part of something dynamic, creative, and constantly
                        evolving.
                        Thatâ€™s when I began looking into technology.</p>

                    <h3>Finding My Footing in Tech</h3>
                    <p>My first hands-on experience in IT came through roles that involved technical support and system
                        maintenance. Working as a Workshop Technician at Konica Minolta South Africa gave me exposure to
                        the
                        inner workings of machines, software installations, and problem-solving in real time. This laid
                        the
                        foundation for my understanding of how tech could be used to support and improve systems.</p>

                    <p>My next major step came during my internship at the University of the Western Cape, where I was
                        introduced to software development. I started working with C# and the .NET framework to create
                        applications and explored automation tools like UiPath and Microsoft Power Platform. Thatâ€™s when
                        it all
                        clickedâ€”I had found the space where creativity met logic.</p>

                    <h3>Embracing RPA and Web Development</h3>
                    <p>Today, Iâ€™m proud to call myself a Junior RPA Developer. Iâ€™ve built apps using low-code/no-code
                        platforms,
                        streamlined processes with Power Automate, and developed web applications using HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript. Every project challenges me to learn something new, and I love the constant growth.
                    </p>

                    <p>Iâ€™ve also been diving deeper into web development, improving my skills through platforms like
                        FreeCodeCamp and Coursera. Creating this portfolio is a big milestone for meâ€”itâ€™s not just a
                        showcase of
                        my work, but a reflection of my journey and what Iâ€™ve learned so far.</p>

                    <h3>Why IT?</h3>
                    <p>What excites me about the tech world is its endless potential. Iâ€™m passionate about building
                        tools that
                        make life easierâ€”especially in areas like education, healthcare, and everyday work processes.
                        The fact
                        that I can turn an idea into a real, functioning application still amazes me. And with every new
                        challenge, I grow a little more.</p>

                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>This is just the beginning. Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning, staying curious, and using
                        technology
                        to make a positive impact. Whether it's through web development, automation, or future
                        explorations into
                        data analytics, Iâ€™m excited for what lies ahead.</p>
