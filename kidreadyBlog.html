    <h3>Building the Kid Ready App</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Kid Ready</strong> app was born out of a passion for supporting early childhood mental health. This
        project aimed to create a safe, engaging space where young children and parents can access mental wellness
        resources designed specifically for early development stages.</p>

    <h4>Highlights & Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed with empathy and research into early childhood psychology.</li>
        <li>Developed a playful, intuitive interface suitable for toddlers and parents alike.</li>
        <li>Balancing a child-friendly UI with meaningful educational content was the most complex challenge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
    <p>This project taught me how to design with empathy, especially for vulnerable user groups like children. I gained
        valuable experience building UX flows that cater to both adults and children simultaneously.</p>
