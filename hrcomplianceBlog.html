    <h3>HR Compliance Platform</h3>
    <p>The <strong>HR Compliance Platform</strong> was built to help businesses track and manage HR policies with ease.
        Using Microsoft Power Apps, I created a low-code solution that enabled HR departments to digitize compliance
        workflows.</p>

    <h4>Highlights & Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Automated reminders for policy updates and acknowledgment tracking.</li>
        <li>Dashboards for HR managers to view employee compliance status in real-time.</li>
        <li>Ensuring role-based access and data privacy was a major challenge within Power Apps' structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
    <p>This project sharpened my ability to create scalable, low-code enterprise apps. It taught me how to navigate the
        Power Platform ecosystem and translate business needs into fully functional solutions.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m proud of the balance achieved between usability and enterprise-grade reliability. Curious to dive deeper?</p>
